Goku is a tool to let you manage your [Karabiner](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements) configuration with ease.

Karbiner Elements uses JSON as it's config file. This leads to thousands lines of
JSON (sometimes over 20,000 lines). Which makes it really hard to edit the config file and iterate on your keymap.

Goku use the [[https://github.com/edn-format/edn][edn format]] to the rescue.

## Why use Goku?

Below are two Karabiner configuration snippets that map caps lock to an escape key.

#+BEGIN_HTML
<p align="center"><img src="resources/images/karabiner.json.png" /></p>
<p align="center">karabiner.json</span>
#+END_HTML

#+BEGIN_HTML
<p align="center"><img src="resources/images/karabiner.edn.png" /></p>
<p align="center">karabiner.edn</span>
#+END_HTML

In practice this means that you can see multiple Karabiner rules on you screen as you edit your config with Goku. Which speeds up the iteration speed significantly as you can create new rules as little as few characters.

** Install
#+begin_src shell
brew install yqrashawn/goku/goku
#+end_src

** Usage

Create a profile named "Goku" in Karabiner GUI tool.

Goku reads ~karabiner.edn~ file which holds your Karabiner config. This file should be placed inside `~/.config/` directory on your mac. If you use a dots dir to hold your config files, you can symlink `karabiner.edn` and Goku will pick up the changes too.

Goku provides two commands:

~goku~: Will update karabiner.json once.
~gokuw~: Will keep watching your ~karabiner.edn~ and on saving, will update your configuration.

Run command ~brew services start~ to use it as a service (runs `gokuw` in background). When Goku is ran as service, the logs are kept inside `~/Library/Logs/goku.log`.

## Tutorial

Read through the [[./Tutorial.org][Tutorial about how you can write the configuration in Goku]].
